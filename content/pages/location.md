    a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't
    give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through
    too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. ##
    Uuummmm, this is a tasty burger! Now that we know who you are, I know who I am.
    I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who
    the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most
    times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You
