    should see Ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world
    once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb
    out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven
    of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that
    I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two,
    but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>"

      No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a

    hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back
    when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p><h3>I'm
    serious as a heart attack</h3><p>My money's in that office, right? If she start
    giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else
    and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot
    that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell
    me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we
    go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
    motherfucker to get shot. You understand?</p>"

      one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people
      who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're
      going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs.
      Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>"
