  content: "<h2>Are you ready for the truth?</h2><p>You think water moves fast? You
    should see Ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world
    once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb
    out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven
    of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that
    I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two,
    but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>"

  content: "<h2>I'm serious as a heart attack</h2><p>Now that we know who you are,
    I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how
    you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the
    hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back
    when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p><h3>I'm
    serious as a heart attack</h3><p>My money's in that office, right? If she start
    giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else
    and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot
    that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell
    me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we
    go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first
    motherfucker to get shot. You understand?</p>"
